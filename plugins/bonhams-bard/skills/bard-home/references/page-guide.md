# How the BARD home page calculates its figures

Use this reference to explain a number or to change a section. All figures come from the `bard_home` tool of the bonhams-bard connector: a cached model computed from the `bard` views in the BARD database. `generated_at` in the model says when it was last refreshed. The page sends no SQL.

## Scope rules applied everywhere

- **Jewellery only:** a lot counts when it sold in a *dedicated jewellery sale*, meaning the sale name contains "jewel" and not watch, handbag, fashion, pens or wine. Lots from mixed or single-owner sales are tagged in the database but left out of the page.
- **Live vs online:** sales named "Weekly" or "Online" are online, and everything else is live. BARD captures Bonhams' full online calendar but mostly only competitors' flagship live sales, so **market share and concentration use live auctions only**. Bonhams' online sales have their own section.
- **Values:** buyer's total (`sold_price`) is the only figure all four houses publish. Hammer exists for Bonhams only, and estimate performance uses hammer because estimates are set against it.
- **Currency:** every value is converted to USD at the **latest ECB reference rate**, refreshed daily inside the database, and the same rate applies to every period. Year-on-year changes therefore exclude currency movement. AUD and GBP figures on the page divide by the latest AUD or GBP rate.
- **Financial year:** July to June, labelled by the June year (FY26 = Jul 2025 – Jun 2026). Share charts show only completed years. The current year appears once competitor sales for it are captured.
- **Region:** taken from the city in the sale name (Geneva → Switzerland, Hong Kong → Asia, and so on), falling back to the sale currency.

## Specialist view

| Section | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Price a piece | Builds a comparables request from the form. Nothing is queried; the text is for pasting into Claude with the Bonhams plugin |
| Top lots, last six months | Top 6 lots per house by USD buyer's total from the last 180 days (three per house on "All houses") |
| How Bonhams estimates are landing | Bonhams sold lots with an estimate, by item type: share hammering below low estimate, within, or above high estimate, plus median hammer ÷ low estimate. Item type comes from keywords in the lot title |
| Data notes | Latest sale captured per house and each house's caveats |

## Management view

| Section | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Headline figures | Bonhams live value for the chosen year and change on the prior year; share of the four houses' live value and rank; sell-through (sold ÷ offered, live and online); current year to date against the same day last year, live and online |
| Share of live value | Each house's share of live buyer's total, by year, with a table of sales, lots sold, value, share and average lot |
| Bonhams by region | Bonhams live value per region and its share of captured live value there. Where Bonhams had no sale, the leading house is named |
| Live sale value by month | Last 24 months, one small chart per house, each on its own scale |
| Reliance on top lots | Share of each house's live value from its top 10% and top 5% of lots, and from its single top lot |
| Bonhams online sales | Online sales, lots, value, share of Bonhams' total and average lot |

## Caveats the page shows automatically

These come from the model's `meta` rows and clear themselves when the data improves:

- **Unknown lot status:** more than 2% of a house's lots lack a sold/unsold status (currently Sotheby's). Its sell-through isn't reported and its lot counts are marked indicative.
- **No hammer prices:** a house publishes buyer's total only.
- **No recent sales:** no sale has been captured for more than 60 days, which usually means the scraper needs attention. The Management view also shows an "Incomplete data" banner naming the house, and that house's current-year figures are understated.
- **Scope:** dedicated jewellery sales are recognised by English, French, Italian and German names ("jewel", "joaillerie", "bijoux", "gioielli", "schmuck") since 4 October 2026, so Christie's Joaillerie Paris is counted. Mixed jewels-and-watches and single-owner collection sales are not. The data notes say so.
